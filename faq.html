      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>1. What is the Inflation Calculator?</h2>
        <p>The Inflation Calculator is a web-based tool designed to help you estimate future costs based on current cost, inflation rate, and time period. It provides real-time results and a visual chart, making financial planning accessible and intuitive for everyone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>2. How do I use the Inflation Calculator?</h2>
        <p>To use the inflation calculator: Select currency (USD/INR), Enter any amount, Choose a past year (1900-2020), and Click "Calculate" to see today's money value in the selected year, purchasing power changes, historical buying examples, and an interactive chart. Works for salaries, prices, or savings comparisons.</p>
        <p>For realtime Inflation Calculator, Simply adjust the sliders for Current Cost (up to ₹50,00,000), Rate of Inflation (0–20%), and Time Period (0–20 years), or click the values below to edit them manually. Results and the chart update instantly as you make changes. It works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>3. Why do the results change in real-time?</h2>
        <p>Tool uses a live calculation based on the compound inflation formula: <strong>Future Cost = Current Cost × (1 + Inflation Rate)<sup>Time Period</sup></strong>. As you adjust inputs, it recalculates immediately to reflect the new projection.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>4. What data does the Inflation Calculator use?</h2>
        <p>The calculator relies on user-provided inputs (current cost, inflation rate, time period). It doesn’t store historical data internally but can be enhanced with external datasets (e.g., RBI or BLS records) in future updates. Current calculations are illustrative, not official forecasts.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>5. Is the Inflation Calculator accurate?</h2>
        <p>The tool provides accurate mathematical projections based on your inputs. However, real-world inflation varies due to economic factors (e.g., policy changes, global events). For precise planning, consult official sources like the Reserve Bank of India or financial advisors.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>6. Why are there limits on the input values?</h2>
        <p>The ranges (e.g., ₹0–50,00,000 for cost, 0–20% for inflation, 0–20 years for time) are set to cover most practical scenarios while ensuring performance and usability. You can suggest expanding these limits via our feedback form!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>7. Can I use this on my mobile device?</h2>
